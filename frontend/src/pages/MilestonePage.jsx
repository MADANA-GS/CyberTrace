This polished metal sphere‚Äîjust 58 cm (23 inches) in diameter with four extending radio antennas‚Äîbegan circling the Earth at an astonishing 29,000 kilometers per hour (18,000 mph). As it orbited, it transmitted a simple but historic series of radio signals‚Äîbeep, beep, beep‚Äîthat could be detected by amateur radio operators worldwide. The launch represented a major technological milestone and demonstrated the Soviet Union's capabilities in rocketry, surprising the global community.

It completed an Earth orbit every 96.2 minutes at a speed of 29,000 kilometers per hour (18,000 mph) at an altitude ranging from 215 to 939 kilometers (134-583 miles). The satellite had an operational lifespan of 21 days until its batteries depleted, completing 1,440 orbits before burning up upon re-entry on January 4, 1958. It transmitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz with a distinctive beeping pattern. The polished aluminum-alloy surface was specifically designed to be visible from Earth with simple optical equipment, and its radio signals could be detected by amateur operators worldwide. This marked the first time in history that a human-made object had been placed in orbit and continuously monitored from the ground.',

This technological demonstration shattered the myth of American invulnerability and created what became known as the 'Sputnik Crisis'‚Äîa period of deep national anxiety about Soviet technological superiority. Major newspapers ran headlines warning of its military implications, and politicians demanded action. The crisis triggered a dramatic shift in national priorities, leading to increased government investment in scientific research and education.

Silbermann, a former Google employee, was inspired by his childhood hobby of collecting insects, envisioning a digital platform where people could collect things they found interesting. The name 'Pinterest' combined 'pin' (as in pinning items to a board) and 'interest.' The platform struggled initially, growing slowly to just 10,000 users after nine months. The turning point came when the team focused on engaging with the early user community in person and optimizing the onboarding experience, leading to stronger growth beginning in late 2011.",
